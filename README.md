# GCMS (GitHub Content Management System) üóÉÔ∏è

GCMS is a command-line interface (CLI) tool designed to manage content on GitHub repositories efficiently. It provides a set of commands to initialize, configure, and manage content through github, making it easier to handle content directly from the terminal.

## Features

- **Initialize Repositories**: 
  - `gcms init --empty`: Initializes an empty repository and sets it as the GCMS repository.
  - `gcms init --from <github_link>`: Clones an existing repository and configures it as the GCMS repository.

- **Repository Information**:
  - `gcms info repo`: Displays information about the local GCMS repository.
  - `gcms info remote`: Shows details about the remote GCMS repository.

- **Detach Repositories**:
  - `gcms detach`: Soft detaches the local repository from the remote.
  - `gcms detach --hard`: Hard detaches and deletes the remote repository, given sufficient permissions.

- **File Management**:
  - `gcms push <filename>.html`: Pushes an HTML file to the repository.
  - `gcms push (-c / --convert) <filename>.ipynb`: Converts a Jupyter Notebook file to HTML and pushes it to the repository.
  - `gcms list`: Lists all files in the local repository.
  - `gcms remove <filename>.html`: Removes files from both the local and remote repositories.
